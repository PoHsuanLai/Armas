## The Problem: Great Tech, Dated Look

Egui is a fantastic immediate mode GUI library for Rust. It is lightweight, fast, and integrates seamlessly with game engines like Bevy.

However, its default styling is strictly utilitarian.

Achieving a modern, polished aesthetic using egui's raw styling API often requires significant effort and custom drawing, feeling like fighting the tool rather than leveraging its strengths.
